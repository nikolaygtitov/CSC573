Command:                Usage:
RS Requests:            Sends specified request to the Register Server. Register
                        Server IP address and port number for connection
                        establishment are known in advance. IP address may vary
                        from server to server. Port number is fixed to value
                        65423.

 register               Sends registration message to the Register Server and
                        provides information about the port to which its RFC
                        server listens.

 leave                  Sends leave requests to the Register Server. Leaves the
                        P2P-DI system, becomes inactive and invisible for other
                        peers and register server in the network. Closes RFC
                        server port. The program remains running. To terminate
                        the program see 'exit'. To join P2P-DI system back, use
                        'register' or 'keepalive' commands.

 pquery                 Sends the query message to Register Server to obtain the
                        list of all active peers from which RFCs and their
                        indexes may be collected. Request is completed with new
                        TCP connection to the Register Server and it receives a
                        list of all active peers that includes the hostname and
                        RFC server port information as a response message from
                        the Register Server.

 keepalive              Sends 'keep alive' message to the Register Server to
                        inform that the peer continues to be active. Upon
                        receipt of this message, the Register Server resets the
                        TTL value for this peer to 7200.


Peer Requests:          Sends specified request to another active peer only in
                        the P2P-DI system. Active peers identified by the
                        Register Server request, e.g. see 'pquery' command.

 rfcquery               Requests RFC indexes from all remote peers that are
                        currently active peers in P2P-DI system.

 getrfc number          Requests to download a specific RFC document from a
                        remote peer. RFC document is specified with 'number'
                        provided by the user. The 'number' argument is required
                        field for this command.


Local Requests:         Local commands that this host will execute locally.

 show arg               arg: peer, rfc
                        Lists requested items defined by 'arg'. The parameter
                        'arg' may take only 2 (two) possible values - 'peer'
                        and 'rfc'.
                        The 'peer' parameter lists all active peers in the
                        P2P-DI system. The list is obtained from the Register
                        Server (see 'pquery' command). This list must be
                        periodically updated to obtain the most recent list. To
                        obtain the most recent list of active peers see 'pquery'
                        command.

 exit                   Terminates the program on the peer. Drops all
                        connections, closes and removes all ports and sockets.
