Command:                Usage:
 register               Sends registration message to the Register Server and
                        provides information about the port to which its RFC
                        server listens.

 leave                  Sends leave requests to the Register Server. Leaves the
                        P2P-DI system, becomes inactive and invisible for other
                        peers and register server in the network. Closes RFC
                        server port. The program remains running. To terminate
                        the program see 'exit'. To join P2P-DI system back, use
                        'register' or 'keepalive' commands.

 pquery                 Sends the query message to Register Server (by opening a
                        new TCP connection), and in response it receives a list
                        of all active peers that includes the hostname and RFC
                        server port information.

 keepalive              Sends 'keep alive' message to the Register Server to
                        inform that the peer continues to be active. Upon
                        receipt of this message, the Register Server resets the
                        TTL value for this peer to 7200.

 rfcquery               Requests RFC indexes from all remote peers that are
                        currently active peers in P2P-DI system.

 getrfc number          Requests to download a specific RFC document from a
                        remote peer. RFC document is specified with 'number'
                        provided by the user. The 'number' argument is required
                        field for this command.

 exit                   Terminates the program on the peer. Drops all
                        connections, closes and removes all ports and sockets.
